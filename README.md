Given that you're starting with a vanilla C++ file in Visual Studio and planning to use OpenGL for your Solar System Simulator, here's a more detailed and specific outline of the first 10 tasks you can focus on. These tasks are designed to progressively build up your project from setting up OpenGL to rendering basic 2D graphics, which you can then expand into more complex 3D visualizations.

1. Set Up OpenGL in Visual Studio
Download and configure necessary libraries like GLFW for window creation, GLEW for managing OpenGL extensions, and GLM for mathematics.
Configure your Visual Studio project to link against these libraries.
2. Create a Window
Use GLFW to open a window. This will serve as your canvas for the simulation.
Implement basic event handling (e.g., closing the window).
3. Initialize OpenGL in Your Project
Use GLEW to initialize OpenGL and confirm it's working by clearing the window with a color.
4. Learn to Draw Basic Shapes
Start with drawing simple 2D shapes, such as circles for planets and a larger circle or sphere for the Sun. Use OpenGL's drawing functions to accomplish this.
5. Implement Basic Animation
Make a simple animation, like a circle moving across the window, to understand the rendering loop and how to update objects over time.
6. Simulate Circular Orbit
Using the knowledge from basic animations, make one circle orbit around another stationary circle at the center (mimicking a planet orbiting the Sun).
7. Add User Input Handling
Implement basic user input handling (keyboard or mouse) to interact with the simulation (e.g., zoom in/out, pause animation).
8. Incorporate Basic Physics for Orbits
Refine the orbit simulation by introducing basic gravitational physics to calculate the orbiting body's trajectory around the central body, making the movement more realistic.
9. Texture Mapping
Learn how to apply textures in OpenGL. Start by applying simple textures to your 2D shapes to give them a more planet-like appearance.
10. Camera Controls
Implement basic camera controls to move the viewpoint around the scene. This could initially be as simple as moving the view left/right/up/down and zooming in and out.



GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library)
Purpose: GLEW manages OpenGL extensions, making it easier to access advanced features of OpenGL that may not be directly available in the core OpenGL version supported by your graphics driver.
Use Case: You'll use GLEW to initialize OpenGL and access various OpenGL functions beyond those provided by the version of OpenGL included with your operating system.
GLFW (Graphics Library Framework)
Purpose: GLFW provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts, and surfaces, receiving input, and handling events. It's designed for OpenGL, Vulkan, and other graphics library applications.
Use Case: You'll use GLFW to create a window, establish an OpenGL context, and handle user input or events (like keyboard and mouse input).
How They Work Together
GLFW is used to create a window and OpenGL context. Without a window and context, you can't render graphics on the screen or receive user input.
GLEW is used after creating an OpenGL context with GLFW to load OpenGL extensions and allow your program to use more advanced graphics features.
Setting Up the Basic Parts of Your Simulator
Initialize GLFW: Start by initializing GLFW and creating a window. This is your application's primary interface for rendering graphics and interacting with the user.
Create an OpenGL Context: Use GLFW to create an OpenGL context associated with the window. This context is necessary for any OpenGL rendering.
Initialize GLEW: With an OpenGL context created, initialize GLEW. GLEW makes it easy to access OpenGL functions, including those beyond your system's base OpenGL version.
Start Rendering: You can now start using OpenGL functions to render graphics in your window. Begin with simple tasks like clearing the screen with a color.
Handle Input: Use GLFW to handle user input, allowing you to interact with your simulation (e.g., closing the window, moving the camera).

Core Classes
SolarSystem:

Responsibility: Manages the overall simulation, including the collection of celestial bodies.
Methods: update(), render(), addBody(CelestialBody*), etc.

CelestialBody (abstract/base class):

Responsibility: Represents a general celestial body with properties all bodies share.
Fields: name, mass, position, velocity, etc.
Methods: update(), render(), etc. Abstract methods for updating state and rendering.

Planet, Star, Moon, etc. (derived from CelestialBody):

Responsibility: Specific implementations for various types of celestial bodies.
Specifics: Each class can have additional properties and behaviors. For instance, a Planet might have orbitRadius and orbitPeriod, while a Star could have luminosity.

Orbit:

Responsibility: Manages the calculation and rendering of orbital paths for celestial bodies.
Fields: radius, focusPoint, etc.
Methods: calculatePosition(time), renderPath(), etc.

Camera:

Responsibility: Manages the view into the solar system, including position, zoom, and orientation.
Methods: move(), zoom(), rotate(), etc.

Renderer (potentially abstract):

Responsibility: Handles low-level rendering operations, abstracting away specific OpenGL calls.
Methods: drawObject(), setShader(), clear(), etc.

ShaderProgram:

Responsibility: Manages OpenGL shader programs, including loading, compiling, and linking shaders.
Methods: use(), load(), setUniform(), etc.

InputHandler:

Responsibility: Manages user input, translating keyboard and mouse actions into simulator commands.
Methods: processInput(window), etc.

UI/HUD:

Responsibility: Manages on-screen display elements like information panels, buttons, or sliders.
Methods: render(), update(), etc.

PhysicsEngine (optional):

Responsibility: Manages physical simulations, such as gravitational interactions between celestial bodies.
Methods: updateForces(), simulateMotion(), etc.

ResourceManager:

Responsibility: Manages resources like textures, models, and shaders, ensuring they're loaded and accessible.
Methods: loadTexture(), getModel(), getShader(), etc
